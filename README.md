# Persistant
Personal Assistant App, built on top of [Flasker](https://github.com/tyu1996/flasker).

## What is this
I have the intention to build an app that acts as an assitant for my daily life. I tend to forget things often (obliviousness), so my solution is in here.

Originally this app is planned to be built with Flutter, but I don't feel I like to do Flutter (after a year of using it, never liked it). I don't feel like to learn Java/Javascript for that too (to build mobile app), so the quickest (laziest) way for me is to use my familiar language and framework to build it: Python, and Flask.

## Roadmap
This is a hobby project. Didn't plan to finish it by any moment, but ofc I wish it can be done faster. I have hell lot of other things (mainly work) to mess with, expect slow progress.

1. **First, I would like to do rough UI design, on how it looks like.**
2. Fill in business logic.
3. Polish the UI & functionalities.

## Misc
- UI: Bulma
- DB: sqlite
- The rest: Flask & its plugins
- Still deciding if user login is necessary
